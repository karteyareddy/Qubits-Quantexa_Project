*Priority-Aware Mini-scale Traffic Flow optimization with dynamic emergency green corridors*

</div>

## 🎯 Abstract

Urban traffic congestion poses a critical challenge not only to daily commuters but, more severely, to emergency response systems where delay can be a matter of life and death. Traditional traffic optimization models, including recent quantum-inspired approaches like the Mini-scale Traffic Flow (MTF) method, typically minimize global network congestion by treating all vehicles as equal entities. This "equity-based" approach often fails to account for the critical urgency required by emergency service vehicles (ESVs).

This project presents a **modified Priority-Aware MTF algorithm** that integrates a weighted prioritization layer into the standard **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** formulation. By assigning distinct, high-value weight coefficients to ESVs within the Cost Hamiltonian, the proposed system dynamically clears **"green corridors"** for priority vehicles while optimizing the remaining traffic flow around them. We utilize the **iterative decomposition method of MTF** to solve these weighted sub-problems on a **D-Wave Quantum Processing Unit (QPU)**. The system is evaluated using a simulated urban environment with mixed traffic, demonstrating that the Priority-Aware MTF can significantly reduce ESV travel time compared to standard quantum optimization, with only a marginal increase in aggregate network latency.

## ❗ Problem Statement

### The Challenge

**Urban traffic congestion delays emergency response vehicles, costing lives.**

- 🚑 Ambulances stuck in traffic can increase response time by 40-60%  
- 🚒 Fire trucks lose critical minutes navigating congested roads
- 🚓 Police vehicles face similar challenges reaching emergency scenes

### Current Solutions Fall Short

Most traffic optimization systems:
- ❌ Treat all vehicles equally (no priority awareness)
- ❌ Use simple shortest-path algorithms (ignore real-time congestion)
- ❌ Cannot dynamically create emergency corridors
- ❌ Don't consider multiple conflicting routes simultaneously

### Our Solution

This project introduces a **Priority-Aware MTF (Mini-scale Traffic Flow)** system that:
- ✅ Integrates a **weighted prioritization layer** into the QUBO Cost Hamiltonian
- ✅ Uses **iterative decomposition** to solve sub-problems on quantum hardware
- ✅ Creates dynamic **green corridors** by penalizing regular vehicles on ESV routes
- ✅ Supports **6 solver backends** including direct D-Wave QPU access
- ✅ Provides **benchmarking** to validate ESV travel time reduction

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚛️ Priority-Aware MTF Algorithm
- **Three-term Cost Hamiltonian**: `H = α·H_route + β·H_congestion + γ·H_constraint`
- **Emergency Boost**: ESVs receive 10× weight in congestion penalty, creating green corridors
- **Iterative Decomposition**: Vehicles split into sub-problems (ESVs first), solved sequentially
- **Congestion Feedback**: Edge congestion updated after each sub-problem for realistic flow

### 🖥️ Six Solver Backends

| Method | Type | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| `neal` | D-Wave Neal SA | **Default** — quantum-inspired, most realistic |
| `sa` | dimod basic SA | Lightweight fallback |
| `tabu` | D-Wave Tabu Search | Alternative for benchmarks |
| `exact` | Brute-force | Tiny problems (<20 vars), guarantees optimum |
| `qpu` | `EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())` | **Direct QPU** — ideal for small MTF sub-problems |
| `dwave` | `LeapHybridSampler` | Large problems (100+ vars) |

> Every cloud solver gracefully falls back to Neal SA if unavailable — the app **never crashes**.

### 🗺️ Real-World Integration
- **OpenStreetMap**: Uses actual road networks from any city via OSMnx
- **Travel Time Computation**: `travel_time = (length / speed) × congestion_factor` on every edge
- **k-Shortest Paths**: Candidate routes generated using Yen's algorithm
- **Graph Caching**: Pickle-based caching for fast repeated loads

### 📊 Benchmarking & Evaluation
- **Standard vs Priority-Aware**: Side-by-side comparison on the same traffic scenario
- **Key Metrics**: ESV travel time reduction %, aggregate latency change %
- **Bar Charts**: Visual comparison of ESV, regular, and aggregate travel times
- **Energy Convergence**: Per-iteration QUBO energy plotted across MTF iterations
- **Detailed Energy Data**: Per-subproblem energy breakdown with emergency/regular tags

### 🎛️ Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
- **Tabbed Interface**: 🗺️ Traffic Map | 📊 Benchmarking & Evaluation
- **Address Input**: Type "From" and "To" — auto-geocoded and snapped to road network
- **Time-of-Day Presets**: Morning, Evening, etc. control vehicle count and emergency ratio
- **One-Click Optimize**: Runs the full MTF pipeline and shows original vs optimized route

### Priority-Aware Cost Hamiltonian

The system formulates traffic routing as a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization** problem with three terms:

```
H_cost = α · H_route_cost + β · H_congestion + γ · H_one_route_constraint

H_route_cost:
  For each vehicle v, route r:
    weight = α × priority_weight   (if emergency)
    weight = α                      (if regular)
    Q[(x_v_r, x_v_r)] += weight × normalized_travel_time(route)

H_congestion (Green Corridor):
  For each shared edge between vehicle_i (route_a) and vehicle_j (route_b):
    if one is ESV and other is regular:
      penalty = β × emergency_boost (10×)    ← forces regular vehicles OFF ESV routes
    if both are ESV:
      penalty = β × 2.0
    if both are regular:
      penalty = β × 1.0
    Q[(x_i_a, x_j_b)] += penalty

H_one_route_constraint:
  For each vehicle v with k candidate routes:
    Q[(x_v_i, x_v_i)] += -γ           (reward selecting a route)
    Q[(x_v_i, x_v_j)] += γ   ∀i≠j    (penalize selecting multiple)
```

**Parameters:**
- `α = 1.0` — Route cost weight
- `β = 2.0` — Congestion/corridor penalty weight
- `γ = 5.0` — One-route constraint strength
- `emergency_boost = 10.0` — ESV green corridor multiplier

### MTF Iterative Decomposition

```
For each iteration (default 3):
  1. Split vehicles into sub-problems:
     - Sub-problem 0: ALL emergency vehicles (solved first)
     - Sub-problem 1..N: Regular vehicles in chunks of 8
  2. For each sub-problem:
     a. Build QUBO with priority weights
     b. Convert to BQM (dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel)
     c. Solve on QPU / Neal SA / Tabu / etc.
     d. Record energy for convergence tracking
     e. Update edge congestion on graph
  3. Merge selected routes into final solution
```

This ensures ESVs always get priority routing, and regular vehicles are optimized around the already-assigned emergency corridors.

## 📊 Evaluation Methodology

The benchmarking system validates the abstract's core claims by running the **same traffic scenario** through two modes:

| Mode | `emergency_boost` | `priority_weight` | What It Does |
|------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|-------------|
| **Standard** | 1.0 | 1 for all | All vehicles treated equally |
| **Priority-Aware** | 10.0 | 10 for ESVs | ESVs get green corridors |

### Metrics Computed

| Metric | Formula | Expected Result |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **ESV Travel Time Reduction** | `(std_esv - pri_esv) / std_esv × 100` | Positive % (ESVs faster) |
| **Aggregate Latency Change** | `(pri_total - std_total) / std_total × 100` | Small % increase (trade-off) |
| **Energy Convergence** | Min QUBO energy per MTF iteration | Decreasing trend |
